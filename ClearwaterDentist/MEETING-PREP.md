# Office Visit — Clearwater Dentist

**Date:** June 4, 2026  
**Client:** Dr. Nadia Pokrovskaya, D.M.D. · Clearwater Dentist  
**Domain:** https://www.clearwaterdentist.com/  

**Bring:** laptop + PSI/Rich Results screenshots + rebuild preview (`npm run serve` → :3457)  
**Deep reference:** `AUDIT.md` · `PRE-VISIT-AUDITS.md` · `rebuild/`  
**Rebuild:** ✅ **72/72 pages built** — `rebuild/dist/`

## ⚠️ Pricing — clarify immediately

She heard **$1,500/month**. You meant **$1,500 one-time**.

| | Amount |
|--|--------|
| **Setup (rebuild + CRM wiring)** | **$1,500 once** |
| **Ongoing (hosting + CRM + automations)** | **~$400/month** |

**Say early:**
> "Just to clarify — the fifteen hundred is a one-time setup for the new site and CRM automations. Monthly would be around four hundred for hosting and keeping everything running, not fifteen hundred a month."

---

## Her primary interest: CRM + automation

Lead with systems, not just website bugs.

**Ask:**
1. What happens when someone fills out the contact form?
2. Do you use Weave for texting/reviews or just booking?
3. Who answers the phone — front desk only or service?
4. How do you request Google reviews today?
5. What does Dentrix handle vs what you do manually?
6. Anyone following up on missed calls?

**Pitch automation package inside the $1,500 setup:**
- Form → CRM → instant patient + staff notification
- Missed call → SMS auto-reply
- Post-visit review request sequence
- One booking link + one phone everywhere

## 45-minute agenda

| Min | Block | Goal |
|-----|--------|------|
| 0–3 | **Pricing clarify** | $1,500 once + ~$400/mo |
| 3–10 | CRM discovery | Forms, phone, reviews, Dentrix, Weave |
| 10–20 | Show rebuild preview | localhost:3457 vs live site |
| 20–30 | Show 3 problems | Phones, placeholder gallery, mobile LCP 9.4s |
| 30–40 | Systems access checklist | GBP, GSC, GA4, Ads, Duda/Xpress |
| 40–45 | Next steps | Canonical phone, CRM tool pick, deploy timeline |

## 60-second pitch (CRM-forward)

> "You mentioned CRM — that's exactly where I'd start. Right now the site has six phone numbers and two booking systems, so even a perfect CRM can't attribute leads correctly. I'd rebuild the site on a foundation you control, wire forms and calls into one CRM, and automate review requests and missed-call follow-ups. Fifteen hundred one-time for setup, about four hundred a month to maintain it — and you'll finally know which marketing actually brings patients in."

```powershell
cd "E:\Website Audit\High Prospective Clients\ClearwaterDentist\rebuild"

- Same header, hero slider, fonts, footer

## Top 4 live-site problems (backup slides)

1. **Phone chaos** — 797-8444 vs 285-8132 vs 758-0243 (+ Ads tracking uses 758-0243)
2. **Placeholder gallery** — "Nature's Symphony" on dental homepage
3. **Mobile LCP 9.4s** — [PSI mobile](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-www-clearwaterdentist-com/6zlhhreqp8?form_factor=mobile)
4. **Duda JS errors** — [Rich Results tested page](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results/result?id=Izy7JEPzZrgP0xQMRVBSeQ) — 49/90 resources failed

## CRM / systems discovery checklist

### Current stack
- [ ] **Duda / Xpress** — login? monthly cost? contract?
- [ ] **Dentrix Ascend** — admin access? official booking URL?
- [ ] **Weave** — CRM active or legacy link only?
- [ ] **Google Ads** — running? who manages? spend?
- [ ] **GBP** — admin access? phone matches which number?
- [ ] **GSC / GA4** — verified? who has access?
- [ ] **Contact form** — goes to email? CRM? encrypted?

### Phone & tracking
- [ ] Official office line: _______________
- [ ] What are 591-4577, 610-7702, 300-0253?
- [ ] Call tracking vendor?
- [ ] Google Ads conversion phone — intentionally 758-0243?

### Automation wish list (let her talk)
- [ ] Missed call text-back?
- [ ] New patient email sequence?
- [ ] Review requests after visits?
- [ ] Appointment reminders?
- [ ] Emergency after-hours routing?

### Compliance
- [ ] HIPAA BAAs — Duda, Xpress, form, SMS, analytics?
- [ ] Before/after photo consent process?
- [ ] SMS opt-in — care vs marketing separated?

## Custom rebuild — confirmed (not Duda cleanup)

| Why rebuild | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Not WordPress | Duda through Xpress — limited control |
| 72 pages, 0 errors | Clean migration |
| Mobile LCP 9.4s | Duda won't fix this |
| ChunkLoadErrors | Broken runtime on live site |
| CRM needs clean data | One phone, one form path |

**Package:** Custom rebuild + CRM integration + automation setup = **$1,500 setup** + **~$400/mo**

---

## Questions she may ask

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "Is $1,500 every month?" | "No — one-time setup. About $400/month ongoing." |
| "Can you keep our booking?" | "Yes — Dentrix Ascend stays, one link everywhere." |
| "How long?" | "Preview is already built. Production deploy 2–4 weeks after content/phone sign-off." |
| "What CRM?" | "Depends on what you use today — Weave, GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Dentrix-native. I'll recommend after today." |
| "Will we lose SEO?" | "No — same URLs, better schema, faster mobile." |

---

## After meeting — your to-do

- [ ] Log canonical phone + booking URL
- [ ] Pick CRM recommendation (Weave vs GHL vs HubSpot)
- [ ] Send follow-up: pricing clarification + rebuild preview link
- [ ] Per-page CSS polish if visual diff found
- [ ] Wire form to chosen CRM
- [ ] Deploy to staging domain
